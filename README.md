# Portals in Unity
This project was taken from Brackeys original:
    https://github.com/Brackeys/Portal-In-Unity
    
My goal is to make the portals Brackeys created into independent self configuring prefabs.
I am also attempting to make it possible to rotate portals A and B in any arbitrary angle.
This does not work yet, but soon will :)

Everything is free to use also commercially (public domain).

Code spreads by natural selection :)
